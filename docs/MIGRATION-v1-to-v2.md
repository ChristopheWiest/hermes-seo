# Upstream historical migration note: Claude SEO v1 to v2

> **Provenance:** The material in this file concerns migration between upstream Claude SEO versions. Its CLI names, install steps, filesystem paths, release facts, test counts, and compatibility claims do not describe the Hermes port. Consult the source project's release history for current upstream guidance.

The Hermes fork derives from the upstream codebase and retains selected scripts, workflows, references, and extensions. It is installed as a Hermes plugin and exposes the managed utility interface `hermes seo setup`, `hermes seo doctor`, and `hermes seo run <script.py> [args...]`. Claude Code installers, settings paths, and commands are not part of the Hermes setup. See [installation](INSTALLATION.md), [commands](COMMANDS.md), and [architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md).
