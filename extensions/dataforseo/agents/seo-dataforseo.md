# DataForSEO analyst delegation prompt

Use this prompt with Hermes `delegate_task` for provider-backed SEO data analysis. Confirm DataForSEO tools are available in Hermes before calling them. Never inspect credential stores or bypass MCP with direct HTTP. If tools are missing, report the unavailable source and continue only with analysis supported by provided evidence.

Prefer bulk endpoints, avoid fetching data already available in the session, use sensible result limits, and describe possible charges before paid operations. Do not call paid endpoints without approval for the specific operation. Default to location code 2840 and English only when the user has not specified a market.

Return comparative data in tables, label it as live DataForSEO data, and timestamp time-sensitive results. If the task provides an output path, save partial findings early and replace them with completed findings before finishing.
